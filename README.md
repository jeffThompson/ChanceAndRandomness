# CHANCE & RANDOMNESS  

> "So much of life, it seems to me, is determined by pure randomness." — Sidney Poitier  

> "The project of life is to be in grace with chance." — André Breton  

During this one-day workshop, we'll explore chance and randomness as tools for making art. Through a series of exercises and in the context of lots of historical examples–from visual art, music, popular culture, science, and technology–we'll investigate the creative potential of letting go of artistic decisions and collaborating with chance and randomness.

Along the way, we'll discuss the differences between chance, randomness, information, and entropy and discuss what happens when, to varying degrees, we remove the artist's hand in favor of mechanism and processes out of our control. The workshop will culminate in time to explore ways that the ideas we discuss could enter your own creative practice.

### CODE OF CONDUCT  
Since this workshop includes a lot of interaction between all participants, it's important for us to create an environment of inclusion and mutual respect. While together, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socieconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit to us all. This doesn't mean we can't disagree, but discussions, critique, and other interactions should be welcoming, inclusive, constructive, and respectful.

If at any point you feel that someone is violating this code of conduct, please let me (via email or DM) or Transart Institute know.

Any suggestions for further diversifying workshop materials are encouraged!
