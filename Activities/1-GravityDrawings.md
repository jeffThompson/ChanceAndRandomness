> "The conclusion that Dada drew from all this was that chance must be recognized as a new stimulus to artistic creation." — Hans Richter, *Dada: Art and Anti-Art*  

> "I use chance operations instead of operating according to my likes and dislikes." — John Cage

In 1933, artist Jean Arp made a piece titled [*According to the Laws of Chance*](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/arp-according-to-the-laws-of-chance-t05005) where he dropped pieces of torn black paper onto a sheet of white paper.

According to Arp:

> "Since the arrangement of planes and their proportions and colours seemed to hinge solely on chance, I declared that these works were arranged 'according to the laws of chance,' as in the order of nature, chance being for me simply a part of an inexplicable reason, of an inaccessible order." (1974)

The rather balanced composition and other works, like the 1930 [*Constellation According to the Laws of Chance*](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/arp-constellation-according-to-the-laws-of-chance-t00242), suggest that perhaps "chance" here is more about surprise than actually leaving things as they fall. But for our purposes, we'll embrace the spirit of the piece's title as a starting point for this workshop.

### INSTRUCTIONS  
* Take several pieces of paper and tear them into random shapes  
* Standing up, let them fall onto the floor (one at a time or in groups)  
* Repeat until you reach an arrangement you like  
* Take a picture with your phone  
* Continue adding to the composition, remove elements, or start over  

Feel free to play with the "rules" here and see what happens! For example:

* What shapes other than randomly-torn pieces could you try?  
* Use newspapers, magazines, junk mail etc and perform the results as a poetic score  
* Insert your own decision-making into the process in some way so that you're "collaborating" with chance, for example:  
  * Always dropping from the center of the composition  
  * Opening a window or going outside to let wind take over  
  * Stand on a chair, on your roof, with your eyes closed, etc  
* If you have different colored papers, try white on black, white on white, black on black, etc
