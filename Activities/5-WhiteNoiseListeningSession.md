# WHITE NOISE LISTENING SESSION  

We'll take a pause from making things to spend some time trying to experience randomness, which we can think of as the mathematically-rigorous version of chance. While we can find randomness across many different arts fields, we'll focus here on sound, first listening to white noise (essentially just random values being heard one at a time in very rapid succession), followed by musical/sound works that embrace and push against the idea of randomness.


### WHITE NOISE  

> "Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin." – John Von Neumann (1951)  

In the 20th century, defining, creating, and measuring true randomness became important for the fields of simulation, cryptography, privacy, and data security. While Von Neumann is correct that computers are essentially deterministic, current research has produced algorithms capable of generating random numbers that rival physical sources. We'll listen to recordings made from five different white noise generators, ranging from vintage, tube-driven lab equipment to cutting-edge cryptographic tools.

**DEEP LISTENING**  
The goal here will be to try to hear the subtle differences in sound (and randomness) of each source. Performer, composer, and leading figure in experimental/electronic music [Pauline Oliveros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Oliveros#Deep_listening) coined the term "deep listening" in 1988. The concepts in deep listening are too varied and interconnected to define in just a few sentences, but the basic idea is to fully immerse oneself in the act of listening, to hear below the surface, and to experience as fully as possible differences in pitch, intensity, tone, and patterns.

Take a moment and...  
* Turn up your audio to a comfortable but loud volume  
* Lie on the floor (preferable) or sit (fine too) in a way that's comfortable  
* Take a moment to focus on the task of listening  

**GENERATORS**  
We'll listen to five different white noise sources – info for each is below.

| GENERATOR | PROPERTIES | NOTES |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| **Type 1390-B** | `T`, `NS` | Built in the 1950s by General Radio Company, this lab-grade generator uses vacuum tubes to generate white noise. Of note, this generator was used by RAND Corporation for the creation of their seminal book *A Million Random Digits*, which was used extensively in statistics and scientific research for decades. The Type 1390-B has a fairly even frequency distribution with slight roll-off on the bottom end and a somewhat warm tube sound. |
| **AES_OFB** | `P`, `S` | One of two high-end, 
"gold standard" contemporary algorithms, AES_OFB was designed specifically for cryptographic use. Part of the Dieharder software suite created by George Marsaglia of Duke University, it has been extensively tested by mathematicians for randomness. AES_OFB is similar to Threefish, but tends to perform slightly better in localized tests for randomness. Of all the generators we will hear, AES_OFB has the harshest, brightest sound, hinting at its pure digital source. |
| **Congruential** | `P`, `NS` | An early algorithm for generating pseudo-random numbers, the Congruential generator uses its previous output to feed into the algorithm and generate new values. Using specially chosen values in the equation, this generator can have a long period of generation before it repeats, though significantly less than the other algorithms. A bit between the Type 1390-B and AES_OFB generators, Congruential sounds less harsh than newer algorithms, retaining a vintage quality. |
| **dev/random** | `T`, `S` | This generator is a mix of physical and algorithm, using entropy from the computer’s hard drive to feed a pseudo-random number generator. Like most cryptographic generators, slow generation is considered a positive quality, and dev/random will stop working until sufficient entropy is built up again. From the Mac OSX manual page for the function: “The quality of its output is however dependent on regular addition of appropriate entropy… Paranoid programmers can counteract this risk somewhat by collecting entropy of their choice.” The sound of dev/random tends to be clear but less harsh than AES_OFB. |

Properties:  
* `T`: true random source  
* `P`: pseudo-random source  
* `S`: crytpographically secure  
* `NS`: not cryptographically secure  


### OTHER MUSIC/SOUNDS  



white noise listening:
- on everyone's computers, for better quality
- then everyone share audio, hear it all together via zoom
- add fade to start of samples
- needs vol equalizing too

- being in the zone... fighting the world, the buffeting of randomness
