# CONNECTING TO YOUR OWN PRACTICE  

John Cage defined three ways a score could be "indeterminate" (include chance):

    Chance procedures to produce determinate, fixed score or recording (flipping a coin to decide if a note or silence should be written down)
    Indeterminate notation (a graphical score, chance comes from how performers interpret the score)
    A combination of the two (score with elements pre-defined using chance as well as open-ended options for performers)


Chavez notes that, while it looks like a book, she sees it really as a sculpture:

    "It's an album for one's inner dialog. The descriptions of the sounds and the words guide the inner ear/dialog to imagine the sound. Then you tear out the pages to remind you of the technique to perform the work yourself. Then you are performing the album. The book itself and how you interact with it is also a sculpture unto itself because of how one interacts with it is their own. I have no influence with it outside of creating the object to be used and imagined. So an album for the inner ear that you allow to come alive on your own."
