# CONNECTING TO YOUR OWN PRACTICE  

> "If poetry has long been the locus of the expression of subjectivity... this poem, composed of random constellations, questions the very possibility of an immediate expression of the author's interiority." – Hannah Higgins, et al on [*House of Dust*](https://www.x-traonline.org/article/objectpoems-alison-knowless-feminist-architexure)  

As the final part of our time together, we'll spend some time thinking and talking about ways that chance and randomness might connect to your own creative practice. The goal here isn't to upend parts of your practice that you care about or find valuable, though I encourage you to be open to that!

Instead, it's about a few different things:  
* Finding pathways of influence outside of yourself  
* Identifying ruts or assumptions in the studio  
* Thinking about ways of releasing control over your creative process  
* Looking for places of friction/disinterest when considering chance; these point to important values you hold

### REFLECTION  
Workshops are chaotic and everything happens so quickly! But let's take a short pause, turn off our cameras and mics, and spend 10 minutes reflecting on what we did today, the prompts above, and any other ways you've been thinking about this topic today. Take some notes or just think, then we'll come back and chat together.

### DISCUSSION  
Creative practice can be a burst of inspiration, but, more often than not, I find that it can be really slow to ferment. You might not have any huge realizations right away, but we'll spend the last 30 minutes or so discussing: 

* Everything we've done today  
* The work we looked at/listened to  
* Your reflection on your own practice  
* And more generally the role of intentionality and careful decision-making in creative work

### BYE!  
Thanks so much for spending today with me talking about chance and randomness, making some weird stuff, and sharing your practices and perspectives! If you come across additional resources or have other thoughts to share, don't hesitate to email me. 👋
