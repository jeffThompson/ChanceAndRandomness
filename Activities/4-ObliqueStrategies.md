# OBLIQUE STRATEGIES    

> "The tornado [in *The Wizard of Oz*] is just such an untrustworthy, sinuous, shifting shape. Random, unfixed, it wrecks the plain shapes of that no-frills life." – Salman Rushdie  

Created in 1974 by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, [*Oblique Strategies*](https://www.enoshop.co.uk/product/oblique-strategies.html) is a set of cards to help break out of creative block and to interject new directions into the artistic process. The first edition, now impossibly rare, was a combination of cards created separately by Eno and Schmidt (see the [*original*-original hand-drawn version here](https://www.openculture.com/2018/12/behold-original-deck-oblique-strategies-cards-handwritten-brian-eno.html)).

Want your own set?  
* [Buy them from Brian Eno for £40](https://www.enoshop.co.uk/product/oblique-strategies.html)  
* [Abandon Normal Devices has additional cards by new media artists](https://www.andfestival.org.uk/ans)  
* [*Grotesque Tables II*](https://www.grotesquetablesii.com/faqmobile) by Noah Wall, where all cards are anagrams of the originals  


### USING THE CARDS  

While the original release was a set of cards in a small box (still available for purchase), the full set of cards are also in [an online version](http://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html), which is what we'll use today.

The instructions card reads:  

> "These cards evolved from separate observations of the principles underlying what we were doing. Sometimes they were recognised in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were identified as they were happening, sometimes they were formulated. They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. In this case the card is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear. They are not final, as new ideas will present themselves and others will become self-evident."

Our process:

### MAKING OUR OWN CARD SET  
With some experience with Eno and Schmidt's cards, we'll create our own set of prompts together. Take some time alone to write as many prompts as you can think of.

Consider:  
* Places in the process of making where chance could be inserted  
* Open-ended actions that change the course of making or ask us to reconsider something  
* Ways of disturbing, upsetting, or otherwise altering with chance  
* Can be directed at a particular media, action, duration, mindest, etc  
* Or be poetic and open to interpretation  

When everyone is done, look through your ideas and pick approximately five that you feel excited about. Copy/paste them into [this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19r_zCrLL11vQRgdgbIfalCGM7Kb-qYL4gK5ddWgXeqw/edit?usp=sharing). I'll put them together into a printable set that you can use later (and that will fit nicely into the box with the full set).
